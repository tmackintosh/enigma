    "# Introduction to Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Cryptography is the practice of encoding secret messages such that they are only readable by the intended recipient and not anyone who intercepts it. This has been studied since ancient times but was vastly accelerated in the first half of the twentieth century for military use during World War I and World War II. This is for obvious reasons – armies need to communicate plans and intelligence throughout their hierarchies. Any means of sending a message in plain text is liable to be intercepted by an enemy. But if you can encode your message so that even the messenger doesn't understand it then this could help tip the balance of a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time that nations were developing more secure codes and ciphers, they were also working around the clock to try to break the codes of their enemies. An especially strong opportunity arose once armies had started using radios to transmit their messages. Radio signals are easily intercepted, so if you can break the code you can lay bare the plans of your opponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most well-known story of code breaking in the modern age concerns a machine that was first built by a German engineer at the end of World War I called the Enigma machine. Initially conceived for commercial use, the German military adopted and used the machine shortly before and during World War II. The British military were able to get hold of one of the commercial machines, so they knew the basics of how it worked; meanwhile, codebreakers in Poland had managed to crack some of the mechanics without one.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1938, the head of the British secret intelligence bought the mansion and land of what is now known as Bletchley Park. This became the home of the UK's code-breaking efforts during World War II, where cracking the Enigma code became a priority. Over the years of the war the mathematicians and codebreakers, most famously Gordon Welchman and Alan Turing, managed to crack the harder variants of the Enigma machine. Some experts estimate that the British military's covert knowledge of German messages shortened the war by at least two years.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about the history of the machine online or even visit **<u>[Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/),</u>** which is now a museum.\n",

    "\n",
    "![an enigma machine](_images/an_enigma_machine.jpg)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To encode a message, you press a key on the keyboard, which lights up one of the bulbs to indicate the encoded letter. You repeat this process for each character in your message. The machine has the usual 26 characters from A to Z.\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine itself is really just a battery connected to several bulbs through switches, not unlike the most basic circuit diagrams you may have seen in school. What makes it complicated is the wiring itself: the route from the battery to the bulb goes through many transformations, and the route changes each time a key is pressed. This means that Enigma is unlike simple substitution ciphers – on the first key press, A might encode into G, but on the next key press, A might encode into W.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting property of the Enigma machine is that the same machine was used for encoding and decoding. So if you reset the machine to the same settings that turned AA into GW, and pressed the keys GW, you would get the message AA back.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were many variants of the Enigma machine, but the basic components were the keyboard, the plugboard, the rotors, a reflector and the lampboard. The plugboard could connect different letters, swapping their values from the keyboard. Then each rotor would transform the letter again, the signal would pass through a reflector, go back through the rotors, back through the plugboard, and then finally light up a lamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "To encode a message, you needed to know the settings. There were five rotors that had different wirings. Of these, three were inserted into the machine. Each rotor had 26 starting positions, which varied per message. Finally, the plugboard allowed for up to 10 pairs of characters to be connected with leads – it is possible to connect all 13 pairs, but the machine only came with 10 leads.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the key is pressed, the rightmost rotor is rotated one position. When the rotor reaches a particular value, this rolls over to the next rotor to the left. So, if you imagine a three-rotor model, every time the right rotor makes a full rotation, the middle rotor moves one position. Every time the middle rotor makes a full rotation, the left rotor moves one position. The exact mechanics of this will be explained later.\n",
    "\n",

    "1.  The battery supplies a current.\n",

    "*   A becomes F\n",

    "\n",
    "If you follow the diagram, you can see that, if we had pressed the D switch instead, then the A bulb would have lit up.

The German military thought this was a strength – intuitively, you might worry if a letter was not changed in your message because, then, part of the message might be easier to guess. But this turned out to be the machine's biggest weakness because it meant code breakers who had cracked part of the code could rule out various combinations which would cause letters to encode into themselves.\n",

    "* Code must be readable. This includes clear use of variables and function names, and appropriate commenting. Comments alone are not worth marks, but if the lack of comments or too many comments makes your code hard to read, you will be marked down.\n",

    "Let's start simulating the Enigma machine with the plugboard, specifically the leads. Each lead in the enigma machine connects two plugs in the plugboard. If we think of the functionality of the plugboard itself in terms of how it encodes a single character, the plugboard *aggregates* the leads, so it makes sense to make a class to represent the lead objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a class called `PlugLead`. The constructor should take a string of length two, which represents the two characters this lead should connect. So the following code:\n",
    "```python3\n",
    "lead = PlugLead(\"AG\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "creates a lead which connects A to G. Remember leads are reversible so this lead also connects G to A. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are still new to object-oriented design, when you are first conceptualising a class, you should take some time to think about what attributes it has and what methods it has. Some will be required by this specification, but you are always free to add more of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the specification, you must implement a method called `encode(c)` on your lead, which takes a single character `c`, and returns the result of this lead on this character. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, with the `lead` object we created above, `lead.encode(\"G\")` should return `\"A\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`lead.encode(\"D\")` should return `\"D\"` – this lead had no impact on the letter D, it only connects A and G. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course even though it would have no effect, it should not be possible to connect a letter to itself – there is only one plug for each letter on the plugboard. For this assignment you should write your code to be robust, obeying the physical limitations of the Engima machine (at least for part one; you may decide to lift these in your extension material). \n",
    "\n",
    "In general “robustness” is left up to your interpretation and discretion, but in this instance your code should `raise` a `ValueError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** at this point we'll note that, of course, whenever the Enigma machine *encodes*, it also *decodes* for the exact same settings. We'll still use the method name `encode(…)` throughout our tests, and take it as assumed that the same method is used for encoding and decoding."

The next step in the process, the rotors, allow the letter substitution to change mechanically every time a key is pressed, which prevents simple frequency analysis.\n",

    "Over time, rotors with many different wiring patterns were developed, and different Enigma machines supported different types and numbers of rotors. We are not necessarily looking for exact historical accuracy in this assignment – for your extension material you might choose to be much more accurate or much less accurate! For this part, you should work on the following specification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your Enigma machine must support *three or four* rotors and one reflector – notice that a reflector is really just a type of rotor where the characters line up in 13 perfect pairs. The rotors will be numbered *from right to left*, which is the “path” the current takes when first entering the rotors. The signal goes through each rotor in turn, hits the reflector, then goes through the rotors again in reverse order (left to right). When it goes through the rotors in reverse order, it uses the *reverse* wiring. So if A is mapped to L when going from right to left, then L is mapped to A on the reverse journey (of course it is not possible to actually hit the same wire on the way back – a letter cannot encode into itself in the machine as a whole).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignoring reflectors, which never rotate, there are two types of rotating rotor, based on whether or not the rotor contains a *notch*. If the rotor contains a notch, then when it is on a certain position and is rotated, it will cause the rotor in the next slot to rotate as well. In addition, in a four slot Engima machine, the leftmost (fourth) rotor never rotates. Rotation will be explained in more detail shortly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each rotor can be chosen from a box containing seven possible wiring patterns. There are two rotors labelled `Beta` and `Gamma`. Then there are five rotors labelled with Roman numerals which do rotate: `I, II, III, IV, V`. You must also support three possible reflector wiring patterns, labelled `A, B, C`.\n",

    "### The Enigma Machine\n",
    "To fully understand rotors, we need to imagine multiple of them in the Enigma machine itself. For this next part, you will need to model many more details of how the rotors work, and in addition work out how to incorporate them into a single machine that is capable of performing the full encoding path.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple Rotors\n",
    "For now, let's ignore the plugboard, and introduce the remaining details for the rotors.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to see the selection of rotors specified in a single sequence from left to right, as the operator would see when looking down, such as on a [German code book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine#/media/File:Enigma_keylist_3_rotor.jpg). For example, on the top row of that linked image, you can see the rotors should be `I V III`. This means the first (rightmost) rotor is `III`, and so on. How you conceptualise the order inside your code is up to you providing it is consistent with the terminology here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code book also specifies each rotor's “ring setting” – in that image you can see the rotors on the top line should be set to `14 09 24` correspondingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The rotor settings will be explained later, but let's first ensure you understand the way the wiring works with multiple rotors. We will show a worked example using three rotors, with all the settings in their default positions – this means you can read the character mappings directly from the table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a `III` rotor sat upright in the machine in the right hand position. The right hand side of the rotor has 26 *pins* and the left hand side has 26 *contacts*, one for each character. The pins on the right are connected to the contacts of the rotor housing which is wired into the plugboard. So if the plugboard sends a signal on the `A` contact of the housing, then this hits the `A` *pin* of the rotor, then this passes through the rotor's internal wiring (check the table for the `III` rotor) and we receive an output signal on the `B` *contact* of the rotor. This will now go into the next rotor: remember there are three or four rotors, followed by a reflector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose there is a `II` rotor in the middle position, a `I` rotor in the left position, and then a `B` reflector. Here is the full path when we send an `A` signal from the plugboard:\n",
    "* `A` signal comes in\n",
    "* `III` rotor receives signal on `A` pin, which connects to `B` contact\n",
    "* `II` rotor receives signal on `B` pin, which connects to `J` contact\n",
    "* `I` rotor receives signal on `J` pin, which connects to `Z` contact\n",
    "* `B` reflector receives signal on `Z` connecting to `T` <br/>\n",
    "  (now the signal goes backwards, hitting the *contacts* and coming out the *pins*)\n",
    "* `I` rotor receives signal on `T` contact, which connects to `L` pin\n",
    "* `II` rotor receives signal on `L` contact, which connects to `K` pin\n",
    "* `III` rotor receives signal on `K` contact, which connects to `U` pin\n",
    "* `U` signal is output\n",
    "\n",
    "The final output for this `A` signal is a `U`. Make sure you can follow this using the table above, as things are about to get more complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rotation\n",
    "As mentioned, the rightmost rotor (first in the order of the electrical circuit) rotates at *the start* of each keypress, i.e. *before* the character signal is passed through the circuit. This is what makes the Enigma machine more powerful than a fixed substitution cipher, one rotation causes a completely different circuit and substitution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation of the rotor advances a setting called the ***position*** of each rotor, which is visible through a window on the machine. This setting is marked on the rotor and is a character between `A` and `Z`, but it is helpful to think of this number as an *offset* rather than a *letter*. In the example above we assumed all of the rotors were set to position `A`. Rotating moves the *pins and the contacts* up by one position (`A` becomes `B`, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "We mentioned before that if we input `A` into the `III` rotor in its default position (which is labelled `A`) then it produces an output of `B`. In our full example we assumed that the rotors were set to `AAA`, but if we set them this way on the machine, then as soon as we press the `A` key the rightmost rotor would rotate giving `AAB`, and this is the circuit that would be made (rotation always happens first). Let's look at what happens in this setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we input an `A` signal from the plugboard, it will come out of the `A` contact of the housing, but it will hit the `B` pin of the rotor due to its rotation by one position. The `B` *pin* is wired to the `D` *contact* (reading from the table).\n",
    "\n",
    "***But*** the `D` contact has also been rotated one position inside the machine, so it actually lines up with the `C` *pin* of the next rotor in its default position. The other two rotors and the reflector work as normal, and on the way back rotor `II` sends a signal on its `E` pin. Since `III` is rotated, this hits the `F` contact which is wired to the `C` pin. But again since it is rotated, this his the `B` contact of the rotor housing, and is what is sent back to the plugboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the full example again, now assuming the rotors are set to `AAB` instead of `AAA`:\n",
    "* `A` signal comes in\n",
    "* `III (B)` rotor receives signal on `B` pin, which connects to `D` contact \n",
    "* `II (A)` rotor receives signal on `C` pin, which connects to `D` contact\n",
    "* `I (A)` rotor receives signal on `D` pin, which connects to `F` contact\n",
    "* `B` reflector receives signal on `F` connecting to `S`\n",
    "* `I (A)` rotor receives signal on `S` contact, which connects to `S` pin\n",
    "* `II (A)` rotor receives signal on `S` contact, which connects to `E` pin\n",
    "* `III (B)` rotor receives signal on `F` contact, which connects to `C` pin\n",
    "* `B` signal is output\n",
    "\n",
    "You can try using the Enigma machine emulator [on this page](https://www.101computing.net/enigma-machine-emulator/). It defaults to the same settings: rotors `I II III` all initially set to position `A`, so when you press the `A` key on the keyboard you should get `B`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you can follow this path using the table of wirings to help you understand how you will implement the behaviour. If you simply do not follow, there are lots of explanations and videos online for Enigma machines. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ring Settings\n",
    "In addition each rotor could be configured by changing the *ring setting*, which is a fixed offset that would apply between the internal wiring and the external markings. The ring settings were either given from `A-Z` or `01-26` – you saw the latter in the code book image linked above, and we'll use these too to avoid confusion with the *position* setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a rotor's ring setting is set to `01` then nothing is changed, the wiring is exactly as written in the table above.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Increasing* the ring setting has the exact same effect as *decreasing* the position setting. It shifts the internal wiring in the opposite direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier we said `A` becomes `U` with the given rotors actually set to `AAA` – we'd have to start on `AAZ` to get this result on the machine, since the rotation happens first (try it on the emulator). Alternatively, we could set the ring position to `02` on the rightmost rotor and set the initial positions to `AAA`, and we'll get the same result for a single press (again you can try this on the emulator; it uses letters for ring settings, if you click the rotor you can set the ring setting to `B`).\n",
    "\n",
    "If we keep pressing `A`, the two configurations will produce many of the same characters, but not always. We have detailed how the rightmost rotor rotates, but not the others, and this detail will eventually produce a difference between the two sets of settings above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Turnover\n",
    "The rotors labelled `I` to `V` have *notches*. If a rotor has a notch and is currently set to its notch position, then it will turn the next rotor on the next keypress (this is called *turnover*). Here are the notch positions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table><thead><tr><th>Rotor</th><th>Notch</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">I</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Q</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">II</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">E</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">III</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">V</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">IV</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">J</td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\">V</td><td style=\"text-align:center\">Z</td></tr></tbody></table>\n",
    "\n",
    "So if a `II` rotor in the first, rightmost, slot of the machine is *currently set to* position `E` then when you press a key the first rotor will turn to position `F` *and* the rotor in the second position will turn as well, and then the electrical signal will be sent through the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `II` rotor had been in the second position, then it will obviously turn much more slowly. But if its position is set to `E` and a key is pressed then it will rotate and turn the rotor in the third position also. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is an important detail here called the *double step*. Normally the second rotor will only turn once every 26 turns of the rightmost rotor. But if the second rotor is *on* its notch setting, then it will turn again *as it turns the third rotor*. Obviously the second rotor must have just rotated to land on its notch, so it actually rotates for two keypresses in a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have the rotors `I II III`, on positions `A C U`. Pressing a key turns the `III` rotor and we get `A C V`. Now the `III` rotor is on its notch, so pressing a key also turns `II` and we get `A D W`. If we continue pressing keys we'll get `A D X`, `A D Y`, `A D Z`, `A D A`, and so on. Several keypresses later we wrap round again and approach the notch on `III` again on setting `A D U`. When we press once we get `A D V`. Now `III` is on its notch so pressing again turns `II` and we get `A E W`. But now `II` is on its notch, so when we press again *all three* rotors rotate and we get `B F X` – `III` turns because it always turns, `II` turns because it is on its notch, and `I` turns because `II` turned on its notch (turnover).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the *ring setting* is inconsequential in this turnover process – it only requires the current position to line up with the notch setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The four-rotor machines did not have a additional lever, and so whether the third rotor had a notch or not the fourth rotor would not turn. In addition if a notchless rotor (e.g. `Beta`) was in the first position, then it will never cause the second rotor to rotate. The rightmost rotor will still always rotate exactly once on every keypress. Notchless rotors can still be set to different position settings as part of the setup process.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are curious about the mechanism, you can see a video of a mock-up version of an Enigma machine in action [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hcVhQeZ5gI4), showing how the the ratchets, levers, and notches contribute towards the rotation on each keypress, and also demonstrating the double step (around 26 seconds into the video)."
